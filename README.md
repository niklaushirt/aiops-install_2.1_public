---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Get it


### Get invited 

To reserve the Watson AIOps demo instance you have to create an issue.

* Click [here](https://github.ibm.com/NIKH/aiops-demo/issues/new/choose).
* And select "Get Started"

Please provide:

- your IBM email, 
- the timeslot for the demo preparation (4h max - to avoid conflicts) 
- the timeslot for the demo (4h max - to avoid conflicts) 
- Customer
- OpportunityID
- and a short description 

We will then send you the login details and invite you to the Slack demo channel.

As soon as you get the mail please follow the steps to [prepare for the demo](./PREPARE_DEMO.md) and/or watch my [video walkthrough](https://ibm.box.com/s/nacwbqzkc71x7t9emv0v8j2r795k0pwz).


## Demo it

You have a complete walk through in the [DEMO GUIDE](./DEMO_GUIDE.md).

**NEW:** I have added a short [Demo Walkthrough](https://ibm.box.com/s/ztshmifg7jhixrgfa2u4jteimw6f287w) video.

>❗**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
>
>- You won’t get any new Alerts, even if you launch the demo script  (they are only pushed upon creation. This is the normal modus operandi of AI Manager that only takes INSERTS and **NOT** UPDATES and DELETES)
>
>- The detected Log Anomalies will probably appear on one of the latest Stories (we don’t have any control over this, this is controlled by AI Manager)
>
>
>If you’d want to create a real example with grouped, new Alerts/Log Anomalies we’d have to reset the demo environment. This is unfortunately not possible in the shared environment as I have to keep the demo environment stable.
>
>Usually for my demos I simulate the error just to show the error in the Bookinfo app and then continue with saying “*let’s suppose that we got the following slack message*” and continue to the pinned Story.
>
>Unfortunately there is no better way for the time being.



## Install it

Find instructions to install your personal demo environment in the [README INSTALLATION](./README_INSTALLATION.md) file.

## Show it

### Offline Click Through Demo

If you need an easy and fast way to demo AIOps in an "almost real" way you can use the Click Through Demo built with PowerPoint.


The file is [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 2021](./AIOps_INTERACTIVE_DEMO_2021_V9.ppsx) in this repository.
