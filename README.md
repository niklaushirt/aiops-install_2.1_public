Find instructions to install your personal demo environment in the [README INSTALLATION](./README_INSTALLATION.md) file.

### Offline Click Through Demo

If you need an easy and fast way to demo AIOps in an "almost real" way you can use the Click Through Demo built with PowerPoint.


The file is [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 2021](./AIOps_INTERACTIVE_DEMO_2021_V9.ppsx) in this repository.
